Open up a command line(assuming you have Ruby installed, and that you ran "gem install sass") type in:
(inside "theme" directory)

"sass td-theme.scss td-theme.css"


That's it! :) Just take the td-theme.css file and place where needed(may have to bring 'fonts' and 'img' folder with you because of referencing in css file, or atleast some of the referenced files, ex: 'svg', 'png' etc.,).
